5/5 Release 1.0 to Sourceforge, create web page
5/6 Add to web documents, message boards, try to setup cvs
5/7 create arbitrary variable storage in pattern
5/8 rewrite dst_read to use pattern variable storage, create proper constructors/destructors for pattern, found and fixed bug in stralloccopy that allocated 1 byte too small (strings are null terminated).  Visit craft show for more ideas.  Corrected end of field delimiters to x0d from x2e (where'd that value come from?)
5/9 rewrite dst_write to use pattern variable storage, moved field extraction to helpers.cpp from csv.cpp, modified csv_read/write to use pattern variables.
5/10 Experiment with PES and PCS files but cannot figure out encoding schemes, not incorporated into program yet.
5/11 Experiment with DragAcceptFiles, ProcessShellCommand, and process mouse clicks in drawing area, none of which work right so leave it all disabled.  I hate MSDN documentation.  Release code as 1.01 on Sourceforge.
5/12 Run through tutorial Scribble
5/13 Start version 1.5 as a new MDI based application.  Pull in pieces of 1.01, until it will run.
5/14 Cleanup of 1.5, review Scribble to create a to-do list to finish 1.5 cleanly
5/14-16 VACATION in San Diego
5/17 More tweaks (document template issues and status bar), continue review of Scribble
5/18 Eliminated automatic new document on startup.  Status bar is updated on change in active window.  Created messages class as a variable in pattern, with all messages being targeted to ONE of the open patterns which allows update all views to work correctly.  Added test routine to handle button clicks and report position.  Modified headers to only include once, and to automatically include pre-requisite headers.
5/21 Tested and found bugs in DST and CSV read/write routines.
5/23 Lots more cleanup.  Fixed bugs in DST and CSV read/write routines.  Fixed bug in menu's being associated with CSV file types.  Added + and - buttons on toolbar to allow scaling more easily than through menu.
5/24 Upload version 1.50 to sourceforge.
5/25 Replaced Document Template Open/Save functions with my own that allow 'All Embroidery Types' to be listed as one of the options.  Upload version 1.51 to sourceforge.
5/28 Add draw and select routines.  Mouse button and move event handlers, allow selecting a region or single stitch, right click to delete a stitch, corrected bug in defining what is top and bottom in pattern coordinates versus screen coordinates, planning out different edit modes, planning out zoom mode.  Implement printing as drawing the pattern top center of page, with text below it.
5/29 Implement zoom.  Pre-calculate translation parameters, create routines to do translation using scrollbar positions, update those calculations at various places whenever things change.
5/30 Clean up zoom, scaling, and resizing windows.  I believe this is 99.99% accurate in maintaining the subject matter at screen center whenever you do any sort of resize, recalculate, zoom, edit, etc.  The one exception is with splitter windows, which two views share one scroll bar.  I'd have to re-write the scrollbar routines to get it to behave differently, not worth it.  Draw speed is significantly improved by only drawing what's needed, and very good clipping functions to reduce the number of lines to draw.  Update() function and UpdateAllViews() pass hints that allow views to remember and reset their subject to the center of the screen, as well as mark update regions in pattern coordinates (since each view can now have different scaling).
5/31 Holiday Monday. Bug swatting, cleanup.  Added color number to stitch entry so that we will be able to copy and paste stitches while preserving their color.  Cursor shape changes when able to move the selection box.
6/1 Re-wrote the mouse handlers to be cleaner and group related functions in one routine, this allowed fixing a few bugs.  Implemented backing store using bitmaps with bitblt, and allow dragging around a bitmap representing the selection area.  A couple little bug fixes.
6/1 Upload version 1.54 to sourceforge.
6/2 Added capability to paint to a bitmap, and use that to draw on screen.  If bitmap cannot be created (not enough memory), then revert to direct draw automatically.  Made all bitmap creations failsafe.  Added OnIdle processing, and established a queue of tasks.  Small bitmaps are rendered immediately, large ones are idle_queue'd.  Added ability to flush tasks by owner and added flush to View's destructor.
6/3 Implemented DOC_MOUSEMODE, with menus and buttons showing current state.  Mouse routines check that state to control functionality.  Disabled BREAK menu options if compiled in release mode.  Added another break mode, so now can break into theApp, Doc, or View to make looking at program state really easy.  Eliminated menus that are Document Template specific (all menus are global).  Corrected selected stitch index when deleting stitch before it.  Implemented line versus point selection modes, as well as display of those selections (as black narrow lines or black hollow circles).  Implemented move of selected area points and lines.
6/4 Added GPL License and comment to all files.  Fixed bug in draw lines selection region.  Added NOP condition for Move command where mouse didn't move.
6/6 Rewrote DOC_MOUSEMODES to split LINE/POINT away from SELECT/MOVE/INSERT/DELETE.  Implemented all these modes.  Implemented keyboard controls: cursors to move edit point through stitch list, insert/del/back to add or delete points, esc to cancel current action.  Implemented cancel action upon windows request.  Implemented time limit in paint bitmap.
6/7 Tweak time limited bitmap rendering, and now use even partial rendered bitmap to reduce screen draw time.  Don't display rendering progress unless compiled as _DEBUG.  Moved FILE_FORMATS_STRING to embroidermodder.h.  Created files AboutDialog.cpp/h and pulled routines out of embroidermodder.c.  General cleanup of embroidermodder.c.
6/8 Create stitched logo for webpage.  Failed to figure out help system.  Speed up delete.  Implement Cut, Copy, Paste, via new global pattern variable 'clipboard', probably should use windows clipboard.
6/16 Started popup menu.
6/19 Implemented popup menu. Implemented delete point, convert to normal/jump commands in that menu.  Implemented Display Jumps button.  Fixed a bug in Move Selection.
6/20 Implemented add text (insert "embroidermodder" at position of current edit point using font from popup dialog box input.)
6/21 Creating Lettering Dialog.  Replaced Rich Edit with normal Edit because something is invalid.  Implemented Lettering Dialog partially: Text, Font, and OK.
6/22 Continued Lettering Dialog: display current font name, associate variables.
6/23 Lots of fine tuning to initialization code for dialog box.  Cannot resolve initial focus to edit box.  Added location.  Added preview (lots of code!).  Changed scale calculation to be accurate based on preview rendering.  Changed actual adding of stitches to reuse preview code, obsoleting entire file fonts.cpp.  Implemented Running Stitch Length, Preserve Details, and # Running Threads in font renderer.  Added more updater callbacks.  Screenshot for webpage.

Notes:

ToDo:
Finish Lettering Dialog features.
Use windows clipboard rather than local variable
Change Color of selection
Make user interface friendlier
Implement a layers or objects functionality.  Window to show object stackup, allow hiding, shuffling, deleting, selecting.

More Font dialog options:
--Shorten Jump stitches, jump stitches along base.

Buglist:
--END stitch is not always at end of pattern.
--Right and bottom pixel is cutoff when rendering.
--Initial focus for Lettering Dialog should be on the text line, not the OK button.
